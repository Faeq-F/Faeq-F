<center>Hello, I am Faeq. A self-taught software developer!</center>

## Who I am
I am currently a student focusing on Computer Science. 

* I'll say it bluntly
  * Some call it stubbornness - I call it passion. You can count on me to always tell you what I mean; only to create the best results for and with you.

## My Passion
